          "name": "Bile Duct Injury",

          "etiology": "The most common cause is misidentification of anatomy (mistaking the common bile duct for the cystic duct) often due to inflammation, aberrant anatomy, or excessive traction. Critical view of safety is crucial for prevention.",

          "risk_factors": "Severe inflammation, acute cholecystitis, previous abdominal surgery, abnormal ductal anatomy, surgeon inexperience, and limited visualization.",

          "diagnostic_criteria": "Intraoperative recognition (cholangiogram showing leak/transection), postoperative bile leak (drain output), persistent jaundice, or signs of cholangitis (fever, pain, labs).",

          "protocol": "Step 1: Immediately recognize injury through cholangiography.\nStep 2: Convert to open surgery if needed.\nStep 3: Control bleeding and assess extent of injury.\nStep 4: Consult hepatobiliary surgeon immediately.\nStep 5: Primary repair if partial injury, hepaticojejunostomy if complete transection.\nStep 6: Place drains and monitor postoperatively.\nStep 7: Start broad-spectrum antibiotics.",

          "etiology": "Slippage of clips from the cystic artery or bleeding from the gallbladder bed during dissection. Can be arterial (rarely) or venous (more common).",

          "risk_factors": "Anticoagulation use, coagulopathies, severe inflammation obscuring the Calot's triangle, or forceful dissection.",

          "diagnostic_criteria": "Sudden drop in hemoglobin/hematocrit, hemodynamic instability, visual pooling of blood in the surgical field, or large post-operative hematoma confirmed by CT/ultrasound.",

          "protocol": "Step 1: Apply direct pressure to bleeding site.\nStep 2: Ensure adequate IV access and fluid resuscitation.\nStep 3: Identify bleeding source.\nStep 4: Use clips, sutures, or electrocautery for hemostasis.\nStep 5: Convert to open if laparoscopic control fails.\nStep 6: Monitor vital signs continuously.\nStep 7: Transfuse blood products as needed.",
